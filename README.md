# Hello-World
My first repository. Just getting started with all of this.
Hi! I'm **Pedro**, i am _Brazilian_ and 19 years old.
I'm more the introverted type, super shy actually, but I get better when I get to know the person better or adapt to the environment.
My passions are video games, music and anime.
I'm a big fan of the ***Power Metal and Progressive Metal*** genre.
My favorite game franchise is ***Final Fantasy***
And My favorite anime genres are ***Slice of life and Romance***. 
Looking to make a future for myself, and acquire more skills i stumbled upon programming, and after some research i made up my mind, i'm going to be a programmer and navigate to its possibilities for the future.
***My big dream is to become a Multi instrumentalist Musician and Musical productor, and my hobby being drawing. But for that i'll need a good paying job, and a lot of studying***.
